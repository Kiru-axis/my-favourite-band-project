                <p>Linkin park is the best rock band out there because as the saying goes <strong>"numbers speak for themselves"</strong>
                Having sold over 100 million records worldwide they are considered one of, if not the best band by rock, metal and pop fans.</p>
                <p>Thier diverse style of music makes them ideal for work-outs and television shows.
                </p>
                <p>The band was formed in 1996 by three highschool friends: Mike Shinoda, Brad Delson and Rob Bourdon.
                    They recruited Mark Wakefield as their lead vocalist and called the band <em>Xero.</em>Lack of opportunities prompted Wakefield to leave and was replaced by Chester Bennington.
                    They decided to change the bands name to <em>Hybrid Theory</em> bur later changed it to <strong>Linkin Park</strong>, to avoid confusion with <em>Hybrid</em>, another British band.
