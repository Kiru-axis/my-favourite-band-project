                    <p>The band was formed in 1996 by three highschool friends: Mike Shinoda, Brad Delson and Rob Bourdon.
                        They recruited Mark Wakefield as their lead vocalist and called the band <em>Xero.</em>Lack of opportunities prompted Wakefield to leave and was replaced by Chester Bennington.
                        They decided to change the band's name to <em>Hybrid Theory</em> bur later changed it to <strong>Linkin Park</strong>, to avoid confusion with <em>Hybrid</em>, another British band. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(British_band)" target="_blank">Read more</a>.
